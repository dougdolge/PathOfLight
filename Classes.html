        <h2>Relax anytime with Savasana</h2><br>
    Prepare yourself for savasava.  Lie down on your yoga mat with your palms up.
        Close your eyes breath slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.  When you
        are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself into a sitting position with
        crossed legs.  Place your hands in a prayer position.  Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste<br>
